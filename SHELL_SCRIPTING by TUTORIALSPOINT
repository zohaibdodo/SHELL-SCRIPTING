### Shell Loop Types:

The while loop: the while loop executes the given commands until the given condition remains true
The for loop: 
The until loop : the until loop executes until a given condition becomes true.
The select loop

###Nested loops:
Loop with in loop.

### Shell Loop Control:

INFINITE LOOP: A loop may continue forever if the required condition is not met
BREAK STATEMENT: It is used to terminate the execution of the entire loop, after completion of code up to the break statement It then steps down to the code following the end of the loop.

#!/bin/sh

a=0

while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   if [ $a -eq 5 ]
   then
      break
   fi
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done

CONTINUOUS STATEMENT: 







Example:

./command -yes -no /home/username
so now..
$# = 3
$* = -yes -no /home/username
$@ = ("-yes" "-no" "/home/username")
$0 = ./command
$1 = -yes
$2 = -no
$3 = /home/username
