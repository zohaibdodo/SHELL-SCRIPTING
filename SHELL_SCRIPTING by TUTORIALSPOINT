Variables:
The name of a variable can contain only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers ( 0 to 9) or the underscore character ( _).

Invalid variables:
2_VAR
-VARIABLE
VAR1-VAR2
VAR_A!

Read-only Variables
Shell provides a way to mark variables as read-only by using the read-only command. After a variable is marked read-only, its value cannot be changed.

#!/bin/sh

NAME="Zara Ali"
readonly NAME
NAME="Qadiri"

Unsetting Variables
Unsetting or deleting a variable directs the shell to remove the variable from the list of variables that it tracks. Once you unset a variable, you cannot access the stored value in the variable.

$unset variable_name

You cannot use the unset command to unset variables that are marked readonly.

Shell Loops:

The while loop: the while loop executes the given commands until the given condition remains true
