#Video 3: Built-in, Keywords and Commands in Shellscript
To check which word is buildin, command or Keywords

type -a echo

if command is shell buildin then it will execute directly and if command is not found it will search in ($PATH) which is predefined.

If you want to show echo with colors then:
echo -e "\033[0;31m Success message here"
echo -e "\033[0;32m Success message here"
echo -e "\033[0;33m Success message here"

Video 7: Comments

"#" Use hash for comments.

Single quote  ' ' is called strong quote which prints as it is.

"\t" tab which is almost 8 spaces.
"\v" vertical tab.
"\n" for new lines.

Video 9:

User define variables
System define variables 

use variable like "${name}

for concatenate variables: ${name}${age}

variable names cannot be reserved words
Variable bame cannot have whitespace in between
the variable name cannot have special characters
the first character of the variable name cannot be a number.

$env

We use system variable in capital letters.

echo ${HOME}
echo ${$}       # process id
echo ${PPID}    # parent process id

Video 11:

#! /bin/bash

read -p "Please enter your name:" name 
read -p "Please enter your age:" age

echo "Your name is $name and your age is $age"

For secret password:

Use -s for secret password

Video 12: Command line arguments

You take input from command while running script

#! /bin/bash

echo ${0}
echo ${1}
echo ${2}

./commandlineargument.sh "zohaib" "shabbir" 3

Video 13:

use curly braces instead while giving command line argument.

echo $# count for command line arguments
echo $@ print all command line arguments

Video 14:

Use ` ` back tick or round brakets ( ) to save output of command in variable

date_time=$(date +"%D-%T")

string="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

echo "${string:0} # This will print from very first letter.

echo "${string:0:3} # This will start from 0 and go till three letters.
echo "${string: -5} # This will start from left and go till five letters.

echo "${string#a*c} # from starting,  Shortest
echo "${string##a*c} # from starting, longest match
