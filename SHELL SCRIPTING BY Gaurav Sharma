#Video 3: Built-in, Keywords and Commands in Shellscript
To check which word is buildin, command or Keywords

type -a echo

if command is shell buildin then it will execute directly and if command is not found it will search in ($PATH) which is predefined.

If you want to show echo with colors then:
echo -e "\033[0;31m Success message here"
echo -e "\033[0;32m Success message here"
echo -e "\033[0;33m Success message here"
