****Shell Scripting****

To check bash support in your operating system:

#cat /etc/shells

To determine Shell

#echo $shell

Create a file with .sh extension (Hello.sh)

echo $BASH     # this will show your shell information

When ever you need to take input from terminal then you will use "read" command
##
echo "Please enter any number"
read name
echo "You have entered $name"
##

When you want take input on same line:

read -p 'name : ' username
echo "name : $username"

#For Passwords or to hide text:

read -sp 'password : ' password

#To insert one line space
echo
#To print hidden input:

echo 'password : ' $password 

For array:

echo "Enter names : "
read -a names
echo "Names : ${names[0]} ${names[1]}"

By Default if you have not set any variable then it will store in $REPLY variable:

read
echo $REPLY

Pass argument:

echo $1 $2 $3 ' > echo $1 $2 $3'

If then else condition:

if [condition]
 then 
  statement 
fi     # To end the if loop

count=10

if [ $count -eq 10 ]
then 
  echo "Condition is true"
fi
